Albuquerque is a wonderful place to live.

However, the police department is ineffective, and in mismanaged.

In 2014 the City of Albuquerque Police Department (APD) was sued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) after 20-people were killed by city police officers over a four-year period ending in 2012, including the infamous [James Boyd shooting](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/12/497660078/albuquerque-police-shooting-trial-ends-in-a-hung-jury). Now in it's 7th year of DOJ supervision, [the latest independant report](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nm/page/file/1334286/download) (PDF) found that the *"APD failed miserably in its ability to police itself."* so that's not encouraging.

Further, there are too many stories to cover in-depth, but here are some other recent low-lights:

In the last fiscal year, Albuquerque spent [19% of its annual budget on Policing](http://documents.cabq.gov/budget/fy-20-approved-budget.pdf) (PDF), most of the top paid employees are  police officers:

For all that money, Albuquerque is still rated as one of the least safe metro areas in the country by property and violent crime, [a worrying trend already this year](https://www.abqjournal.com/2380171/year-to-date-homicides-up-significantly.html).

That said, I love it here.
