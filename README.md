Albuquerque is a wonderful place to live.

However, the police department is ineffective and mismanaged. 

----

In 2014 the City of Albuquerque Police Department (APD) was sued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) after 20-people were killed by city police officers over a four-year period ending in 2012, including the infamous [James Boyd shooting](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/12/497660078/albuquerque-police-shooting-trial-ends-in-a-hung-jury). Now in its 7th year of DOJ supervision, [the second latest independent report](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nm/page/file/1334286/download) (PDF) found that the **"APD failed miserably in its ability to police itself."** so that's not encouraging. The [most recent report](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nm/file/1404816/download) is more promising, but similar problems abound: **"At this point, the disciplinary system at APD routinely fails to follow its own written policy (guiding disciplinary matrices) and virtually decimates its disciplinary requirements in favor of refusals to recognize substantial policy violations, and instead, often sustaining minor related violations and ignoring more serious violations"**.

Further, there are too many stories to cover in-depth, but here are some other recent low-lights:

In the 2020 fiscal year, Albuquerque spent [19% of its annual budget on Policing](http://documents.cabq.gov/budget/fy-20-approved-budget.pdf) (PDF), most of the top paid employees are  police officers ([source](https://publicreports.cabq.gov/ibmcognos/bi/?perspective=classicviewer&pathRef=.public_folders%2FTransparency%2FTop%20Earners%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Albuquerque%20List&id=i5AAD1EA752BA417099BA819E482F6642&objRef=i5AAD1EA752BA417099BA819E482F6642&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22%3A%22i5AAD1EA752BA417099BA819E482F6642%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22report%22%2C%22defaultName%22%3A%22Top%20Earners%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Albuquerque%20List%22%2C%22permissions%22%3A%5B%22execute%22%2C%22traverse%22%5D%7D)):

![How much is too much?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimNagle-McNaughton/APD_salaries/main/barplot.png)

For all that money, Albuquerque is still rated as one of the least safe metro areas in the country by property and violent crime, [a worrying trend this year](https://www.abqjournal.com/2380171/year-to-date-homicides-up-significantly.html), tying [the record for homicides by August](https://www.abqjournal.com/2417797/city-breaks-yearly-homicide-record.html), with [an additional 21 homicides by mid-November](https://www.koat.com/article/albuquerque-police-102-homicide-coors-dions/38286002).

That said, I love it here.
